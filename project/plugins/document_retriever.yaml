  This plugin takes a query and returns a list of documents that are most relevant to the query.
  The query should be a well-formed sentence that describes the user's information need.
  The document base is a collection of documents about a project named "TaskWeaver".
  If the query is not clear, or irrelevant to the topic, then should not call this plugin.
  If you want to answer a question about TaskWeaver, the answer should be strictly based on the documents.
  You cannot make up an answer that is not in the documents, otherwise bad things will happen.
